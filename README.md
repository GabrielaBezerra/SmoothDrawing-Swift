# SmoothDrawing-Swift
A smooth drawing app in Swift.

Thanks to <a href="https://www.altamiracorp.com/blog/employee-posts/capture-a-signature-on-ios">Jason Harwig's Tutorial</a> . I have learned to implement smooth drawing in iOS using objective c.

Failing to find any drawing tutorials in <strong>swift</strong> I have converted the one discussed in the tutorial in swift. 

For complete tutorial check out this <a href="http://cocoabite.com/post/110000170154/smooth-drawing-in-swift">blog post</a> on <a href="http://www.cocoabite.com">CocoaBite</a>.

This is the <strong>swift version</strong> and it demostrates how to implement smooth drawing in iOS.

## How to Use ?

Add this file to your project 
<strong>DrawableView.Swift</strong>

In <strong>Xcode's Interface builder</strong> select the view you want be able to draw on and <strong>set its class</strong> to <strong>DrawableView.swift</strong>.

Run the project.

And that's it.

### Happy Drawing
